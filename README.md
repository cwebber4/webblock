Exploratory work on creating a website blocker.

It is essentially a proxy that blocks or allows requests. It is very basic. The only goal was to find out how one might make a website blocker. Things would have gotten more complex when dealing with SSL and such.

A Patricia Trie would have been used to model the list of blocked URLs for easy matching.
